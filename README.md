# Demo 2

This repo was created locally on my machine, and added to git in VS Code
Before you can do a git push, you need to tell git where the remote git is.  To do that, create a new repo in GitHub 
with the same name (e.g. demo-repo-2).  Then connect your local repo with the remote repo using the following git command:  git remote add origin https://github.com/apowers543/demo-repo-2.git
